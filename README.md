# Dotflow News Application

This is the Dotflow News Application, a React-based project that fetches and displays top headlines from various categories using the NewsAPI service.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DMSdivyamanas/Dotflo_news.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
    cd your-repo

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start

## Why Run Locally?
This application fetches data from NewsAPI, which has restrictions on requests from servers on the free plan. To use this application, it's recommended to run it locally on your machine. NewsAPI allows requests only from localhost, which means hosting this app on a live server might not work due to the restrictions imposed by NewsAPI's free plan.
